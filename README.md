Analyzing NYC Real Estate data with Tableau 

Sheet 1: The real estate investment company is interested in analyzing a record of every building or building unit sold per borough in the NYC market. 
I built a table that compares all the Boroughs within New York City real estate data by total amount of units.
I created a calculated field that uses a logical statement to change the Borough field from numbers to the name of the Borough, <b> 'Borough Name' </b>
- 1 = "Manhattan"
- 2 = "Bronx"
- 3 = "Brooklyn"
- 4 = "Queens"
- 5 = "Staten Island"
- 
Sheet 2:  Created a heat map to visualize the best time to buy property throughout the year for each borough 

Sheet 3 + 4: I converted the Commercial Units and Residential Units fields into percentages. 
The hope is that this will help describe the percentage of total units sold per group, 
allowing informed decisions to be made about the type of property to look for (commercial or residential) and in which Borough.

Sheet 5: I created a map of the Boroughs of NYC, showing the Price Per Square Foot for each Borough.
In order to so, another calculated field was created to reflect the price per square foot.
' Sale Price / Gross Square Feet ' = <b> Price Per Square Foot </b>

Sheet 6: Treemap of average price per sq. ft. by zip code 

Sheet 7: Bar chart of average sales price by NYC neighborhood 

Sheet 8: Story presentation
